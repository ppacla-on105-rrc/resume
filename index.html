    <h3>About Me</h3>

    <p>Hi my name is Philip Pacla-on, I am a recent graduate from Red River College
        AD&D Program. I have a passion for techonology and problem solving,
        Through my 2 year course I have learned and gained hands-on experience

        motivated person who is now looking for an opporunity to apply the knowledge
        ive gained through out the years where I can contribute while continuing
