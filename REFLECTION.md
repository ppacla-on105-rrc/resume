# Can I explain what my code does?

In this project, I built a resume using HTML codes. I used headers to highlight 
important subjects and paragraphs to explain them further. I injected images & links to
make it more engaging and with these it helped meet the projects objectives.

# What was my coding process?

My approach to this assignment was to research what code I needed first to
better understand how it was going to help me accomplish my final goal. I watched
youtube tutorial and once I felt comfortable I tried it and kept checking the
validator to make sure it was working as intended. I organized my work 
by following the Pep8 standard, I made sure my codes was readable and made sure
only codes that were needed was on the project not anything more.

# What challenges did I have?

The challenge I faced was finding the right source of code to be able to meet
my work requirement, The way I faced this challenge was to just try them all and
see which was the best option top use.

# What would I do differently now?

I would plan more, I would spend more time planning everything out first before
coding which can help me stay more organized and avoid making more mistakes.
